## Music Files: 

Death.mp3 HIT.mp3 GOT.mp3 Replay.m4a
## Known bugs or Crashes: 
Music Stops playing at random times: Sometimes the music stops playing randomly, usually when the game has been running for a slightly longer time. I am running the game in ElCapitan, and I get the following error everytime a music file is ran using media player library in Java fx. "This application, or a library it uses, is using the deprecated Carbon Component Manager for hosting Audio Units. Support for this will be removed in a future release. Also, this makes the host incompatible with version 3 audio units." When I researched about this error, I found that this was an El Capitan related error. The music file runs well if I add it in the launch method as the background music, but I want to add other sound effects too in the game.

## Extra Features: 

Sound Effects
